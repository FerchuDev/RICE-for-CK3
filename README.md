## Latest Version: Version 1.16.0.a Hotfix for "Buddha of Light" (Released 5/20/25, for vanilla patch 1.16.x)

**Newest Flavor Pack: *Manicheism: The Religion of Light***

[**Discord**](https://discord.gg/9KuyXv2uZA) | [**Official Website**](https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com) | [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/Cybrxkhans_Mods)

_Please recite: purity, light, power, wisdom, the supreme perfect truth, Mani the Buddha of Light._
_- Inscription dated to 1445 CE at Cao’an Temple, China, one of the few intact Manichean temples_

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and is technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.


## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is a WIP version and not necessarily stable!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the "RICE" folder and "RICE.mod" file from the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

The mod folder should look something like this:

**NOTE**: When re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, make sure you are not subscribed to the Steam version of the mod, to prevent the launcher from getting confused as to which version to use.

- Increased cooldown for the Manichean confession decision to three years
- Temporary fix for potential CTD when playing as Zhang Huaishen in 867 and choosing to send yourself as a Tang hostage, or not sending anyone, by disabling those options for players

- Purification doctrines are now also available to non-Dualist faiths with the Gnostic tenet

- Fixed Votive Offerings not being available as an activity option for the local pilgrimage to Tapama Djenepo’s tomb
