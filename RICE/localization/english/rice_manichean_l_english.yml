We will avoid that which perpetuates the entrapment of Light in Matter, such as eating food (especially that which is not vegetarian), consuming intoxicating substances, and engaging in sexual acts."

And then, suddenly, one by one, more voices join in, of all the [Glossary( 'Elect', 'ELECT_GLOSS' )] and [Glossary( 'hearers', 'HEARER_GLOSS' )] in the room.\n\nWe come together, singing together the hymns of our faith. We come together, weeping in sorrow as we remember the [Glossary( 'parinirvana', 'MANICHEAN_PARINIRVANA_GLOSS' )] of Mani. We come together, weeping in joy, as we confess our sins, and Mani descends from the Light high above, and absolves us of those sins.\n\nFor a moment, there is nothing surrounding me but the sound of Light, of purity, of power, of wisdom, and the vision of the #italic Bema#! throne, empty save for the portrait of Mani."

The #italic Bema#!

 manichean.0034.desc:0 "At last, this year’s #italic Bema#! Festival has come to an end. Mani had come to absolve us of the sins we’ve confessed, as more and more Light was freed and returned to the heavens. Such a powerful, grand, intense event only happens once a year, but we will be ready for the next occasion. Until then, we should do our best to engage in virtuous acts to free the Light, and scorn the Darkness wherever we can."
