 TERTON_GLOSS: "#bold Tertöns#!, or #bold treasure revealers#!, are those who have uncovered hidden religious texts called #bold terma#! in [GetFaithByKey('lamaism').GetName], or Tibetan Buddhism, and [GetFaithByKey('bon').GetName]. It is said that these teachings were hidden long ago by highly realized masters, particularly Padmasambhava in Buddhism, and Tonpa Shenrab in Bon, because people were not ready for the teachings yet, or to protect them from harm by evil forces. Although termas are often texts, they can also come in the form of statues, holy objects, dreams, humans, and more; termas can be found physically, such as in caves, under rocks or water, or within one's mind. Though strongly associated with the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, and Bon, tertöns have come from all schools of Tibetan Buddhism."
