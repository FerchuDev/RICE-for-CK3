 galicia2.0040.desc.vladimir:0 "[oleg.GetFirstName], spawn of that witch [anastasia.GetFirstName], has inherited father’s titles that should rightfully be mine! Father was no wise man, but a fool who listened to his snotty little mistress, rather than my mother, his true wife.\n\nThere are many boyars who have promised to support me, should I press my claims. Yet I know they cannot be fully trusted; I may have to look for allies elsewhere, such as among our distant [vladimir.GetDynasty.GetName] relatives, or even foreign rulers. In the end, I’ll do whatever is necessary to continue enjoying my luxurious lifestyle – one I surely deserve, and not [oleg.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 galicia2.0040.desc.oleg:0 "That arrogant, puffed-up, degenerate [vladimir.GetFirstName] would have normally inherited the titles that father bestowed on me, given he is my older half-brother. Father likely foresaw that [vladimir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would be an ineffectual ruler, easily controlled by the same boyars who cruelly murdered my mother, [anastasia.GetFirstName].\n\nThose same boyars will do all they can to get [vladimir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] on the throne. I may have to look for allies elsewhere, such as among our distant [vladimir.GetDynasty.GetName] relatives, or even foreign rulers, to pacify these troublesome boyars, eliminate [vladimir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], and survive. My father knew that I was the better heir, and I will not disappoint him!"
