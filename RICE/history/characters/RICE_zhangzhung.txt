# HRUK WER / HRUGS WER FAMILY
# (Prominent noble family and patrons of Buddhism in Guge, and clan of Rinchen Zangpo, the famous translator)
# Most members below, outside of Rinchen Zangpo's immediate family, are from donors at a mural in Tholing dating to the early 11th century around the time of King Yeshe-O
# The mural may have been made to honor Yeshe-O's memory shortly after his death, so maybe around 1020s earliest (CK3 vanilla has him dying in 1040).
# I cannot find information on their family relations, so I will resort to some fictitious relations between the family to keep them connected
# If anyone reading this knows more about the family's dates that would be more accurate, please let me know!

# There are several other names of donors from the Hrugs family at the donor site, but the article doesn't really give much more detail about them
# 
# According to The Social and the Religious in Early Post-Imperial Tibet, they had estates in Skyin wer ba, Mkhar Bdu lang Kyung rtse (perhaps identifiable with the present Mkhar rtse area?)
